A local-search service app like Yelp.
======
This is a prototype of a local-search service app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service.
The project is built with react, and now is an incomplete version, since the real back-end sever has not developed yet. Instead, a fake backend was built for test.
